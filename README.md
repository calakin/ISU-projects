# ISU-projects
This is a collection of odds and ends that I have worked on in my classes and managed to keep. They are organized by class and then by assignment/project. I will include a description for each project, including what it is, how to use it, and its current state of functioning. Most are currently as I left them when submitting, but I will be working on fixing some up.
