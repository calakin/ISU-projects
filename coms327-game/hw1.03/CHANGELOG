9/21/2017:	Imported solution code from homework 1.02.
		Created changelog and readme.
		Created dungeon.c, utility.c, and pathfinding.c
		Moved all but main from rlg327.c to dungeon.c
		Renamed rlg327.c as main.c
		Created my own Makefile, produces executable rlg327.exe
		Created dungeon.h, utility.h, pathfinding.h
		Transferred definitions and function declarations to dungeon.h
		As of this point, the code functions as it should for hw 1.02
		New files need filled for 1.03 functionality

		Added spawnPC() to utility.c
		Fully implemented spawnPC()
		Added ter_player_character to terrains and rendering
		Added spawnPC() to main.c, just before rendering
		Declared findDistance() in pathfinding.h
		Declared mapAllDistances() in pathfinding.h
		Declared displayDistances() in pathfinding.h
		Added stubs for those functions in pathfinding.c
9/23/2017:	Fully implemented all functions except find_distance()
		Added show_distance() to use all of the pathfinding functions
		and give the desired assignment functionality.
		Implemented show_distance()
		Added pathfinding functionality to main.c
		Fixed all compiler errors
		Need to fix bug where immutable border has random chars 
		Code was not setting values for outer border (fixed)
		Currently, find_distances just sets all to 0, need to implement
		using djikstra's.
9/27/2017:	Implemented djikstra's using previous solution code as a 
		starting point.
		Fixed compile errors and a segmentation fault.
