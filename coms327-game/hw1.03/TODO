1.	Look up how the solution displays the original dungeon map
2.	Model displayAllDistances after that
3.	Fully implement display all distances
4.	In mapAllDistances, implement using findDistance. Iteratively for
	tunneling and maybe recursively for not tunneling
5.	Study up on djikstra's
6.	Write out psuedocode for djikstra's
7.	Use professor's djikstra's as a start in findDistance()
